<h1><u>History of Coffee</u></h1>
        
        <p>The history of coffee dates back to the 15th century, and possibly earlier
            with a number of reports and legends surrounding its first use. The native
            (undomesticated) origin of coffee is thought to have been Ethiopia.The earliest
            substantiated evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree is
            from the early 15th century, in the Sufi monasteries of Yemen, spreading soon
            to Mecca and Cairo. By the 16th century, it had reached the rest of the Middle East,
            South India (Karnataka), Persia, Turkey, the Horn of Africa, and northern Africa.
            Coffee then spread to the Balkans, Italy, and to the rest of Europe, as well as
            Southeast Asia and then to America, despite bans imposed during the 15th century by
            religious leaders in Mecca and Cairo, and later by the Catholic Church.
        </p>
        

        <p>The earliest credible evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appears in the late
            15th century, by Sufi Imam Muhammad Ibn Said Al Dhabhani who is known to have imported goods from Ethiopia
            to Yemen.
            Coffee was first exported out of Ethiopia to Yemen by Somali merchants from Berbera. In addition, Mocha,
            which was the centre of the coffee trade for much of the early modern era, obtained most of their coffee
            from Somali merchants based in Berbera. Sufis in Yemen used the beverage as an aid to concentration and as a
            kind of spiritual intoxication when they chanted the name of God. Sufis used it to keep themselves alert
            during their nighttime devotions. A translation of Al-Jaziri's manuscript traces the spread of coffee from
            Arabia Felix (the present day Yemen) northward to Mecca and Medina, and then to the larger cities of Cairo,
            Damascus, Baghdad, and Constantinople. By 1414, the beverage was known in Mecca, and in the early 1500s was
            spreading to the Mameluke Sultanate of Egypt and North Africa from the Yemeni port of Mocha. Associated with
            Sufism, a myriad of coffee houses grew up in Cairo (Egypt) around the religious University of the Azhar.
            These coffee houses also opened in Syria, especially in the cosmopolitan city of Aleppo, and then in
            Istanbul, the capital of the Ottoman Empire, in 1554. In 1511, it was forbidden for its stimulating effect
            by conservative, orthodox imams at a theological court in Mecca. However, these bans were to be overturned
            in 1524 by an order of the Ottoman Turkish Sultan Suleiman I, with Grand Mufti Mehmet Ebussuud el-İmadi
            issuing a fatwa allowing the consumption of coffee. In Cairo a similar ban was instituted in 1532, and the
            coffeehouses and warehouses containing coffee beans were sacked. During the 16th century, it had already
            reached the rest of the Middle East, the Safavid Empire and the Ottoman Empire. From the Middle East, coffee
            drinking spread to Italy, then to the rest of Europe, and coffee plants were transported by the Dutch to the
            East Indies and to the Americas.
            Similarly, coffee was banned by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church some time before the 18th century. However, in
            the second half of the 19th century, Ethiopian attitudes softened towards coffee drinking, and its
            consumption spread rapidly between 1880 and 1886; according to Richard Pankhurst, "this was largely due to
            Emperor Menilek, who himself drank it, and to Abuna Matewos who did much to dispel the belief of the clergy
            that it was a Muslim drink."
            The earliest mention of coffee noted by the literary coffee merchant Philippe Sylvestre Dufour is a
            reference to bunchum in the works of the 10th century CE Persian physician Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi,
            known as Rhazes in the West, but more definite information on the preparation of a beverage from the roasted
            coffee berries dates from several centuries later. One of the most important of the early writers on coffee
            was Abd al-Qadir al-Jaziri, who in 1587 compiled a work tracing the history and legal controversies of
            coffee entitled Umdat al safwa fi hill al-qahwa عمدة الصفوة في حل القهوة. He reported that one Sheikh,
            Jamal-al-Din al-Dhabhani (d. 1470), mufti of Aden, was the first to adopt the use of coffee (circa 1454).
            He found that among its properties was that it drove away fatigue and lethargy, and brought to the body a
            certain sprightliness and vigour.

        <h1><u>The Meaning of The Word</u></h1>
        <p>The word "coffee" entered the English language in 1582 via the Dutch koffie, borrowed
            from the Ottoman Turkish kahve, in turn borrowed from the Arabic qahwah (قهوة).

            The Arabic word qahwah originally referred to a type of wine, whose etymology is given by
            Arab lexicographers as deriving from the verb qahā (قها, "to lack hunger") in reference to
            the drink's reputation as an appetite suppressant. The word qahwah is sometimes
            alternatively traced to the Arabic quwwa ("power, energy"), or to Kaffa, a medieval kingdom
            in Ethiopia whence the plant was exported to Arabia. These etymologies for qahwah have all
            been disputed, however. The name qahwah is not used for the berry or plant (the products of
            the region), which are known in Arabic as bunn and in Somali and Oromo as būn. Semitic languages
            had the root qhh, "dark color", which became a natural designation for the beverage. According
            to this analysis, the feminine form qahwah (also meaning "dark in color, dull(ing), dry, sour")
            was likely chosen to parallel the feminine khamr (خمر, "wine"), and originally meant "the dark one".
        </p>
    
   
    
        <h1><u>The First Cafe</u></h1>
        <p>
            The world’s first recorded historic coffee house, Kiva Han, was reputedly opened in
            Constantinople (Istanbul). Shemsi of Damascus and Hekem of Aleppo, are generally
            acknowledged as our first recorded coffee house proprietors having opened one in
            Talchtacalah, Constantinople in 1555.

<h2><u><b>Coffee Roast Type Guide</b></u></h2>
        <h3>Roasting is a heat process that turns coffee into the fragrant, dark brown beans we know and love.</h3>

        <h4>Why do we roast?</h4>
        <p>
            Roasting brings out the aroma and flavor that is locked inside the green coffee beans. Beans are stored
            green,
            a state in which they can be kept without loss of quality or taste. A green bean has none of the
            characteristics of a roasted bean -- it’s soft and spongy to the bite and smells grassy.
            Roasting causes chemical changes to take place as the beans are rapidly brought to very high temperatures.
            When they reach the peak of perfection, they are quickly cooled to stop the process. Roasted beans smell
            like coffee, and weigh less because the moisture has been roasted out. They are crunchy to the bite, ready
            to
            be ground and brewed.
            Once roasted, however, they should be used as quickly as possible before the fresh roast flavor begins to
            diminish.
        </p>

     

        <h4>Roasting is an art and a science</h4>
        <p>
            It takes years of training to become an expert roaster with the ability to “read” the beans and make
            decisions
            with split-second timing. The difference between perfectly roasted coffee and a ruined batch can be a matter
            of seconds.
        </p>

        

        <h4>
            Know your roasts
        </h4>
        <p>
            Most roasters have specialized names for their favored roasts and there is very little industry
            standardization.
            This can cause some confusion when you’re buying, but in general, roasts fall into one of four color
            categories —
            light, medium, medium-dark and dark.

            Many consumers assume that the strong, rich flavor of darker roasts indicates a higher level of caffeine,
            but the
            truth is that light roasts actually have a slightly higher concentration.

            The perfect roast is a personal choice that is sometimes influenced by national preference or geographic
            location.
            Within the four color categories, you are likely to find common roasts as listed below. It’s a good idea to
            ask before
            you buy. There can be a world of difference between roasts.

            Light roasts
        </h4>
        <p>
            Light brown in color, this roast is generally preferred for milder coffee varieties. There will be no oil on
            the surface of these beans because they are not roasted long enough for the oils to break through to the
            surface.

        <p>
            This roast is medium brown in color with a stronger flavor and a non-oily surface. It’s often referred to as
            the American roast because it is generally preferred in the United States.

        </h4>
        <p>
            This roast produces shiny black beans with an oily surface and a pronounced bitterness. The darker the
            roast,
            the less acidity will be found in the coffee beverage. Dark roast coffees run from slightly dark to charred,
            and the names are often used interchangeably — be sure to check your beans before you buy them!

<h2><u>North America & The Caribbean</u></h2>

    <h4>United States - Hawaii</h4>
    <p>
      Though coffee farms are found throughout the Hawaiian islands, it is
      Kona coffee, from the large island of Hawaii, that is best known and
      always in high demand. Here, nature provides just the right environment
      for the coffee trees on the slopes of the active Mauna Loa volcano.
      Young trees are planted in black, volcanic soil so new that it often
      seems the farmers are growing seedlings in rock. Afternoon shade from
      tropical clouds forms a natural canopy over the trees to protect them
      from intense sun, and frequent island showers give the plants just right
      amount of rain. Kona coffee is carefully processed to create a
      deliciously rich, aromatic cup of medium body.
    </p>

    <h4>Mexico</h4>
    <p>
      Small Mexican coffee farms are more common than large plantations, but with over 100,000 coffee farmers,
      Mexico ranks as one of the largest coffee producing countries in the world. Most farms are in the southern
      states of Veracruz, Oaxaca and Chiapas. A cup of Mexican coffee generally offers a wonderful aroma and depth
      of flavor, often with a pronounced sharpness. It is an excellent bean for dark roasts and is often used in
      blends. A Mexican coffee designated Altura means that it was grown at high altitudes.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Puerto Rico
    </h4>
    <p>
      Coffee was brought to Puerto Rico from Martinique in 1736, and by the late 19th century, the island was the
      sixth leading exporter of coffee in the world. However, major hurricanes and competition from other coffee
      producing countries forced the island to seek other means for economic survival. Today, the coffee industry
      is being revived with carefully cultivated coffee from quality Arabica varieties that are produced to the
      highest standards. There are two major growing regions on the Caribbean island: Grand Lares in the south
      central region, and Yauco Selecto in the southwest. Both regions are noted for their beans’ balanced body
      and acidity, as well as a fruity aroma.
    </p>

    <h2><u>
        Central America
      </u></h2>
    <h4>
      Guatemala
    </h4>
    <p>
      While perhaps not as well-known as some of its Central and South American neighbors, Guatemala's coffee has
      a distinctive taste quality favored by many for its rich flavor. There are three main growing regions —
      Antigua, Coban and Huehuetanango — each with a breathtakingly rugged landscape and rich volcanic soil.
      Microclimates strongly influence the quality and flavor of the “strictly hard beans” (grown at altitudes
      4500 feet/1370 meters or higher). This medium-to-full bodied coffee has a depth and complexity of taste
      that is almost spicy or chocolatey.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Costa Rica
    </h4>
    <p>
      Costa Rica produces only wet-processed Arabicas. With its medium body and sharp acidity, it’s often
      described as having perfect balance. Costa Rican coffee is grown on predominantly small farms, or fincas.
      After harvest, the cherries are immediately taken to state-of-the-art processing facilities, known as
      beneficios, where wet method processing begins. The careful attention to quality processing and conscientious
      growing methods have built Costa Rica’s reputation for fine coffee.
    </p>

    <h2><u>
        South America
      </u></h2>
    <h4>
      Colombia
    </h4>
    <p>
      Colombia is probably the world's best-known coffee producer and ranks second worldwide in yearly production.
      A high standard of excellence is maintained with great pride and careful growing on thousands of small family
      farms across the country. Such care and attention results in consistently good, mild coffees, with a
      well-balanced acidity. The rugged Colombian landscape provides the perfect natural environment for growing,
      but the terrain makes it difficult to transport the harvested coffee beans to production and shipment centers.
      Even today, this is often done by mule or Jeep. Colombian Supremo, the highest grade, has a delicate, aromatic
      sweetness while Excelso Grade is softer and slightly more acidic.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Brazil
    </h4>
    <p>
      Brazil is the biggest coffee producing country in the world, with seemingly endless expanses available for its
      production. Coffee plantations in Brazil often cover immense areas of land, needing hundreds of people to manage
      and operate them to produce huge quantities of coffee. Both Arabica and Robusta are grown, and the climate, soil
      quality and altitude determine which variety will grow best in which region. A fine cup of Brazilian is clear,
      sweet, medium-bodied, and low-acid.
    </p>

    <h2><u>
        East Africa
      </u></h2>
    <h4>
      Ethiopia
    </h4>
    <p>
      Coffee legend tells of the discovery of the first coffee trees in Ethiopia -- it’s not hard to believe that coffee
      originated where wild coffee tree forests are still the primary harvesting source. Generally wet processed,
      coffee from Ethiopia comes from one of three main growing regions — Sidamo, Harrar, Kaffa — and often bears one
      of those names. In the cup, an Ethiopian coffee tends to offer a remarkable and bold statement: full flavored, a
      bit down-to-earth and full bodied.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Kenya
    </h4>
    <p>
      Kenyan coffee is well-known and well-liked, both in the United States and Europe. The beans produce a sharp,
      fruity acidity, combined with full body and rich fragrance. Coffee is grown on the foothills of Mount Kenya, often
      by small farmers. Kenyan producers place an emphasis on quality and as a result, processing and drying procedures
      are carefully controlled and monitored. Kenya has its own unique grading system. Kenyan AA is the largest bean in
      a
      10-size grading system, and AA+ means that it was estate grown.

        West Africa
      </u></h2>
    <h4>
      Ivory Coast
    </h4>
    <p>
      The Ivory Coast is one of the world's largest producers of Robusta coffee, which is strongly aromatic with a light
      body and acidity. This variety is ideally suited for a darker roast, so they’re often used in espresso blends.
    </p>

    <h2><u>
        The Arabian Peninsula
      </u></h2>
    <h4>
      Yemen
    </h4>
    <p>
      In the country where coffee was first commercially cultivated, coffee is still grown in the age-old,
      century-proven
      manner. Within the small, terraced gardens of family farms, you can almost always find a few coffee trees.
      Since water is scarce in this arid land, coffee beans grown here tend to be smaller, and more irregular in size
      and shape. Lack of water also means that the coffee cherries will be dry processed after harvest. The result is
      that Yemeni coffee has a distinctive taste that is deep, rich and like no other.
      In ancient times, when coffee was shipped from the famous Yemeni port of Mocha to destinations all over the world,
      the word Mocha became synonymous with Arabian coffee. The Dutch combined Arabian coffee with coffee grown on the
      island of Java to make the first coffee blend -- and one that is still well-known today -- Mocha Java.
    </p>

    

    <h2><u>
        Asia
      </u></h2>
    <h4>
      Indonesia
    </h4>
    <p>
      Indonesia, one of the world's largest countries, is composed of thousands of islands. Several of the larger
      islands — Sumatra, Java, and Sulawesi — are known throughout the world for fine quality coffee. The coffee plant
      was introduced to Indonesia by Dutch colonists in the 17th century, and the country soon led the world's
      production. Today, small coffee farms of 1-2 acres predominate and most of it’s dry processed. Indonesian coffees
      are noted for a pronounced rich, full body and mild acidity.

      Indonesia is also known for its fine aged coffees, which were held over a period of time by farmers who wanted to
      sell them at higher prices. Warehousing gently ages the coffee in Indonesia's warm, damp climate and results in a
      coffee prized for even deeper body and less acidity. This process cannot be matched — even with today’s
      technology.
    </p>

   

    <h4>
      Vietnam
    </h4>
    <p>
      Coffee originally came to Vietnam in the mid-nineteenth century when French missionaries brought Arabica trees
      from
      the island of Bourbon and planted them around Tonkin. More recently, coffee has been re-introduced and the coffee
      industry is growing so rapidly that Vietnam is rapidly becoming one of the world's largest producers. Today, small
      plantations, located in the southern half of the country, produce mostly Robusta coffee. With light acidity and
      mild
      body with good balance, Vietnamese coffee is frequently used for blending.

<h2><u><b>Coffee Grind Time</b></u></h2>

        <p>
            “Extraction is arguably the most important and least understood aspect of coffee brewing,” says Barista
            Hustle’s Matt Perger.

            Put simply, extraction is the method of pulling the flavor from your coffee beans. It’s the magic that turns
            water and
            beans into a beautiful beverage. As water passes through the grounds, it dissolves all sorts of compounds
            that end up in
            your cup.

            But this is where things get tricky: As Food and Wine notes, “Some of those compounds taste great, but
            others are kind of
            nasty. To get the good ones, and the right amount of them, you need to properly extract your coffee, meaning
            that the water
            dissolves the right stuff, and the right amount of it.”

            As a general rule, brewing methods with longer contact time require a coarser grind (and vice versa – your
            espresso should
            be very fine). If this seems like a lot to consider before your first cup of coffee, don’t worry.
